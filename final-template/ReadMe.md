# Final Report

## ITMT 430 2019 - Giancarlo Barillas

### Sprint 4

In this sprint this is where we first began constructing the user interface with react. I was project manager of this sprint. My job at this sprint was to manage people. This sprint I made it important to all of us about our availability. I made everyone create a schedule of their availability using a site called when is good. The purpose of this was to show the team times where you could meet up with someone else. Some of the schedules created were like the figures below. These were made on march 29.

As project manager I was in constant communication with the team. I made sure that people were on time with their task. This was also the first sprint where we all joined together on Thursday and made substantial commit. Unfortunate this was the only time where we were all able to meetup for extended periods of time.

At the start of this sprint we did not have an organized folder structure for the development of react components. I made the hierarchy for the folder structure so that we would be able to store our new react components in folder that made sense for easier access. I also broke down the index.js page so that it can call react component by importing them. This can be shown in the commits: f6cfcb3 and f9166dd. These commits are shown below.

I also created the initial react components for the sign up and log in page so that we could developed those component simultaneously as show in commit 5cf08a549927b0eee815366c7b7c7358391b0b24. While other teammates were building the CSS of those pages I dealt with the logic behind those pages. At the time we initial thought that we would use states to control the way that buttons connected to each other. This initial logic can be seen the commit: 1a58173. This logic was tedious, we later changed this in the following sprint by using react router and Navlinks. This logic was not scalable since it would require us to make new states for every page. I created the initial aboutme page for sign up so that we could build that page while I continued to work with button functionality in commit: 49ed4b7. I dealt with some of the CSS on the initial pages in commit: 7947b2c. I also created the first logic to pass properties throughout pages. These properties were used to capture inputs throughout multiple react components. This was used to later create the user via the API calls. This was further developed in the following sprint. These commits are shown below
